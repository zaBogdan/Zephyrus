# zaEngine - short-term plans.

### No longer supporting this project.
This application needs to be finished as it is.
Due to time I will not continue this project because is just a useless pain to do it. 

### Left to finish this project
- [ ] Create an automated instalation process (implement it right this time)
- [ ] Link the backend with the frontend
- [ ] Add user roles
- [ ] Wrap around the project, make it work for everyone.


### Changes to be made
This project will be splitted into microservices. You will ned to create the following:
- [ ] Authentification
- [ ] Logging server
- [ ] File Handler 
- [ ] Database Interaction

Change the frontend to ExpressJS
Add all of these to docker containers and send to AWS Kubernetes.
