This is a Content Management System created for learning purposes. It has suffered a lot of changes and improves during this commits. If you want to see a changelog of this look at the [Versions ](#versions). Project is not regularly maintained and can have severe security issues because of the little time I have.

# Installation with Docker
I tried to automate as much as I could and these are the new steps:
* Clone the repository 'git clone https://github.com/zaBogdan/Zephyrus.git'
* Change to the directory 'cd Zephyrus'
* Run the composer to get all dependencies 'composer install'
* Make sure you change credentials from 'docker-compose.yml' file
* Start up docker with 'docker-compose up --build' (use --build only first time!)
* Go to the web at 'http://localhost:8000/admin/install/' and follow the instructions there

> **Note:** The credentials in 'docker-compose.yml' can be anything you want. There are just for setup purposes. But make you need to reuse them in order to make the connection to database!

And that's it. You've installed the application!

# Installation without Docker
Even if I don't recommend it because it can be a huge pain on some operating systems, these are the steps.
* Clone the repository 'git clone https://github.com/zaBogdan/Zephyrus.git'
* Change to the directory 'cd Zephyrus'
* Run the composer to get all dependencies 'composer install'
* Now you have everything needed, so you need to set up the webservice
* You need PHP, Apache2, PHPMyAdmin and MySQL installed on your system. Also an active Mailgun account and a TinyMCE one.
* Go to the web at 'http://localhost:8000/admin/install/' and follow the instructions there

> **Note** I recommend this tutorial for installing the LAMP stack if you are on a linux distro: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04

# Future plans
Even if it's in an alpha stage this project will be maintained but it will not have regular updates, because I am short on time. Hopefully it will become one day a powerful, scalable CMS.

These are some features I want to add:
- [x] Manage Images & Videos (FileSystem)
- [ ] Posts (TextSystem)
- [ ] Manage content generated by users (ManagementSystem)
- [ ] Pretty urls
- [ ] User interactions & communication (SocialSystem)
- [ ] Working with data (StatisticsSystem)
- [ ] Handling errors and requests (Logger)

# Known bugs
These are the bugs found during pentesting session. If you find more please inform me. 

> **Note** Not all bugs found here are solved. at the end there are specified vulnerable versions.

- [x] A valid token can be used anywhere, no matter of it's scope (<0.2)
- [x] Emails lose their style (<0.3)
- [x] You can't install the application if you are not logged in, and you can't login because there is no database. (Only for 0.3)
- [x] Session cookies are not encrypted. (<0.4)
- [x] Remote code execution in `Upload Files` page. (<0.4)
- [x] Tokens are the same as UUID, not generated securely. (<0.4)
